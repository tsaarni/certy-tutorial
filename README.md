# Streamline Your Testing: Generate Test Certificates with Ease

Generating certificates and keys for testing environments can often feel like a chore.
If you’ve wrestled with complex OpenSSL commands or written lengthy bash scripts to automate certificate creation, only to end up committing those certificates to your repository, you’re not alone.

In this tutorial, we will explore a uniform way to make certificate generation simple and streamlined, using YAML for command line or programmatic interfaces in Go, Java, and Python.
